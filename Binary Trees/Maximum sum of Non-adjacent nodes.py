# Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any children or parents in consideration and vice versa.

                                        
# Example 1:
# Input:
#      11
#     /  \
#    1    2
# Output: 11
# Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
# node 11.


# Example 2:
# Input:
#         1
#       /   \
#      2     3
#     /     /  \
#    4     5    6
# Output: 16
# Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
# nodes 1 4 5 6 , i.e 16. These nodes are
# non adjacent.

# NOTE:
# all the nodes' values are in the range [0, 10^9].
