# Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.



# Example 1:
# Input:
# N = 2
# Arr[] = {2, 2}
# Output: 2 1
# Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
# smallest positive missing number is 1.


# Example 2:
# Input:
# N = 3
# Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
# Output: 3 2
# Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
# smallest positive missing number is 2.
